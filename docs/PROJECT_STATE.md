# PolitiTrack project state

**Current as of:** 2026-09-08 15:33 UTC

**Canonical repository:** ID `1349678672`, `maglothinm/MyETF-Intelligence`; default branch `main`.

**Recovery control revision:** `db080d413b5e804a335f575071a62d48a9d4083b` (PR #151).

## Production authority

**September 8 release hold:** PR #156 merged as `140944de3d0da9b76e6318714babad75212dab32`, but live acceptance found a category mismatch between review JSON and insights for two retained House paper PTRs. The rollout was held. All six resources were restored to the retained image below, and Dashboard execution `polititrack-dashboard-jktkd` appended a valid publication with hash `8286a37ad8db2657fe11244098e708c3b4196f462296b7b5e21e721488974f5b`; the rejected publication remains retained in history. Four original producer schedulers were re-enabled at 15:33 UTC. A classification-order correction passes 1,159 tests and awaits corrective PR CI/deployment. Issue #155 is not yet accepted live.

Legislative has a separate pre-existing retry guard after Senate HTTP 403 at 10:41 UTC. Its accepted generation 232 and blocked-run evidence remain intact. See [the incident record](incidents/2026-09-08-legislative-retry-guard.md). Historical September 6 success evidence below does not imply current Legislative health. PR #154 remains unmerged and excluded.

Runtime v2 is the production authority. The earlier shadow/blocked description in this file was stale. Phase 5 completed in canonical run `34005780266`, attempt 1, at `9f4303623cf21c3dff434fbb7240c07e6d255174`. Artifact `9981508660` has archive SHA-256 `c5094a1677712e413425e118f29dd0fc1f870c5bc712879fbc2223f2b9c2f7d0`. Its `phase5-complete.json` independently matches checksum `0006ed72a2a42308c21084bee236c45f4e9e17df4803c244caf03a520028dcb7` and result `phase5_complete`.

That certificate records the original production transfer. The subsequent concurrency repair and natural-schedule recovery have separate evidence; the original certificate is not a certificate for the repaired image.

## Runtime recovery

PR #142 repaired snapshot-reader/writer concurrency. Production now uses immutable image `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/project-38008d5f-4918-46e6-920/polititrack/runtime-v2@sha256:2902dc72b23bccfdcff95f71e2ea79d699c96352d9ae3195e8d2940f02bfb4bd`, with producer source revision `72c1ca8c74a7af4b11f2e677c7a296d5e2358578`, verified as an ancestor of current main.

Scheduler reactivation run `34046362664` succeeded. All four producer schedulers are enabled. AI uses `14,44 * * * *` in America/New_York; Dashboard retains `2,17,32,47 * * * *` in Etc/UTC. Filing Vault lifecycle remains paused. Cloud SQL public IPv4 remains disabled and its private network remains `polititrack-runtime-v2`.

Natural-certification run `34047080001` failed in preflight because its Dashboard timezone assertion contradicted both Terraform and the live Scheduler. PR #151 corrects the assertion and selects logs from the recorded activation timestamp instead of a sliding four-hour window. It does not change production schedules or runtime code.

Corrected certification run `34059488724`, attempt 1, job `101557337973`, completed successfully at control revision `db080d413b5e804a335f575071a62d48a9d4083b`. Artifact `9997087643` independently matches archive SHA-256 `6b35663482221d972f0967f0d2fba5eb68865609541c5693d29c093d4369c58f`. Its certificate reports `runtime_v2_natural_ai_schedule_certified`, cleanup pending false, and temporary execution/logging authority removed. Both internal evidence hashes were independently verified.

## Live functionality

Independent GCP reads show successful recent Legislative, Executive, AI, and Dashboard executions. AI natural runs committed generations 63 and 64 at 17:17 and 17:48 UTC. Public `/readyz` returned ready and `/` returned HTTP 200 with the same snapshot hash at 20:56 UTC. The certified durable heads are Legislative 82, Executive 46, AI 70, and Dashboard 79, all bound to repaired source revision `72c1ca8c74a7af4b11f2e677c7a296d5e2358578`. The served hash matches the certified Dashboard 79 head. AI executions `polititrack-ai-rss97` and `polititrack-ai-db5vt`, followed by `polititrack-dashboard-vl4p6`, were independently checked in GCP: all succeeded, used the approved digest, and were created by the existing Scheduler service account.

## Preserved boundaries

No replatform, state initialization, rewind, rebaseline, protected artifact replacement, legacy route activation, or Phase 6 decommissioning is authorized. The original Phase 5 evidence and all recovery predecessors remain retained. Runtime database/snapshot authority must not be confused with the pre-cutover GitHub artifact authority described in historical documents.
